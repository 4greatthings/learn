# Getting started with Enigma

[Enigma](https://enigma.co) is building a privacy layer for the decentralized web. First researched at MIT, **_Enigma’s network of “secret nodes” can perform computations over encrypted data at scale_** without ever exposing the raw data itself. By finally enabling decentralized applications to use private and sensitive data, smart contracts built with Enigma become “[secret contracts](https://blog.enigma.co/defining-secret-contracts-f40ddee67ef2)”, allowing developers to create thousands of new, valuable solutions.
