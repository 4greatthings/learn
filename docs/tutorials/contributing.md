## Tips for contributing

1. Make sure all new features are tested on the canary branch.
2. Bug fixes must include a description demonstrating the error that it fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before submitting
   a pull request. Large features which have never been discussed are
   unlikely to be accepted. *You have been warned.*
